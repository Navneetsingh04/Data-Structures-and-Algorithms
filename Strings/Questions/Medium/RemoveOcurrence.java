/*
L.C: 1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring
Given two strings s and part, perform the following operation on s until all occurrences of the substring part are removed:
Find the leftmost occurrence of the substring part and remove it from s.
Return s after removing all occurrences of part.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
Example 1:
Input: s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"
Output: "dab"
Explanation: The following operations are done:
- s = "daabcbaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 2, so s = "dabaabcbc".
- s = "dabaabcbc", remove "abc" starting at index 4, so s = "dababc".
- s = "dababc", remove "abc" starting at index 3, so s = "dab".
Now s has no occurrences of "abc".
